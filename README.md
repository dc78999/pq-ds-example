This repository contains some utility scripts used to assist the attempt of compiling and running post-quantum digital signatures on ARM Cortex-A53 processor.

The aims is to launch an emulator of raspberry pi 3 which runs the ARM Cortex-A53 processor. Then fetch the targeted post-quantum digital signature scheme from the [additional digital signature round of NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/pqc-dig-sig/round-1-additional-signatures) then compile and run them on this emulator.


## Preparation
